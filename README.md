### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Here, I have created a webpage that will display a random poster with a random inspirational title and quote. I have also branched off this idea an provided an "Un-motivational" posters list. I don't think anyone had a problem before, but if you need to come up or get put down, this is the page for you!!!

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
As a student in mod2 at Turing, I felt this was one of the easier projects, only taking me around 4 days to complete. I do find more success and fulfillment after completing a project when I can visually see it working. I have discovered a new love for FE work and look forward to pursuing more knowledge in Javascript and FE languages.
