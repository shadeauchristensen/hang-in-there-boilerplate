## What is this? Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Here, I have created a webpage that will display a random poster with a random inspirational title and quote. I have also branched off this idea and provided an "Un-motivational" posters list. I don't think anyone had a problem I was trying to solve, but if you need words of encouragement, get brought down a peg, or even just make a poster of your own, this is the page for you!!!

## Some Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
As a student in Mod 2 at Turing School (Cohort 2410), this project felt relatively straightforward, taking about four full days of dedicated work (approximately 5-7 hours per day). Completing a project with visible, interactive features provided a deep sense of accomplishment. Through this experience, I developed a newfound passion for front-end development and look forward to expanding my knowledge of JavaScript and related front-end technologies.
  
## My Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Entering the tech industry as a newby has been an exciting and continuous learning experience. Throughout this project, I explored new JavaScript methods and applied them to build dynamic functions for my webpage. Every challenge provided an opportunity for growth and reinforced my problem-solving skills.

## The Wins + Challenges: ðŸ¥‡
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

#### Wins
  
â€¢	Successfully developed a fully functional, interactive webpage.
  
â€¢	Completed the project ahead of schedule, allowing time for thorough refactoring and code optimization.

#### Challenges:
  
â€¢	I found the hardest moments were those were we had to match the displays to the prompts with the existing code.
  
â€¢	Managing frequent back-and-forth checks between the provided prompts and the required persistence, attention to detail, and problem-solving.

[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

	1. Open Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash/Command Prompt (Windows).
   
	2. Navigate to Your Desired Folder:
   
  	 	- Replace `path/to/your/folder` with the location where you want to clone the repository: `cd path/to/your/folder`
   	  
	3. Go to the GitHub Repository:
   
   		- Visit the GitHub repository page you want to clone.
   	   
	4. Copy the Repository URL:
   
   		- Click the green **Code** button. Select **HTTPS** and click the **copy icon** (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repository.git`).
   	   
	5. Clone the Repository:
    
   		- In the terminal, type the following command, replacing `REPOSITORY_URL` with the URL you copied: `git clone REPOSITORY_URL`
   	  
	6. Navigate Into the Cloned Repository:
 
    	- Replace `repository-folder-name` with the folder name created after cloning: `cd repository-folder-name`

	7. Verify the Files Are Cloned:
    
   		- Use this command: `ls` (Mac/Linux) or `dir` (Windows)
     
	8. Open the Project in VSCode (Optional):
    
  	 	- If you have VSCode installed, type: `code .`  

**Tip:** **Use `git remote -v` to verify the correct remote URL is linked to your cloned repository.**
